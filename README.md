This app will be performing actions on xing website. This includes sign in, collecting some data, having conversations with recruiters and so on.  
Even though this project has been open sourced, its very specific to my personal interests and needs. Don't expect any documentation on what and how it does. One of the reason is that I'm not aiming to spread or make people use this app.  
Good news is that nothing prevents you from reading the code, making fork and adopt it for your needs.
